# homework-five
Okay, this was a better assignment for me. I feel like I finally am understanding the concepts in phase one. Let me briefly go over how this submission fufills all the  requirements.

The current day is displayed at the top. Timeblocks are presented in the correct manner. Timeblocks are color coded to indicated whether a even is happening, has happened, or will happen. You can click and save an event for that timeblock, and the timeblocks list the standard business hours. The text is then saved in the local storage, so that when the page is refeshed the saved event persist. Therefore it satisfies all the acceptance criteria and utilizes the a date utility library.

Application deploys correctly, loads with no errors, submitted to github correctly. Github repo contains the code.

Application user experience is intiutive and easy to navigate, as well as clean and polished. Furthermore, it is identical to the mock-up functuality and nearly identical in terms of look.

Repository has a unique name, follows best practices for file structure and name conventions. Repository contains mutitple commit messages and this updated readme file.

Everything has been completed well and cleanly. I am very happy with my submission and actually enjoyed this assignment. Thank you, thank you for taking the time to read this.
